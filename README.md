   Destination-Podcast is a MVP application used to consolidate two helpful applications into a single place for the user.
   Using the Listen Notes API and the Mapquest API we have developed an application that allows the user to search for gps
   directions using Mapquest.  Depending on the length of the trip the Listen Notes API will fetch a list of podcasts that 
   correspond with the length of the user's trip.  Allowing the user to focus on the road instead constantly checking their phone
